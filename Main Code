# TODO:
# Change dialogue to fit for each character
# Define different starting stats for each class (Attack, defense, block, evade, gold and dot(for the dragon)) 
# Create monsters and boss and their stats. 
# Create combat! (Attack, defense, block, evade, health potion(only if player has one)) 
# Attack values are between 2 numbers. A bit like rolling the dice. 
# Defense is a percentage based reduction. 5 defense = 5% less damage taken
# Block is -50% any attacks. Sometimes, blocking can lead to a 100% damage reduction (critical block). I'll do this choosing a random number between 1 and 5, and
# ... if random.int falls on that number, it'll do a critical block
# Same thing for critical attacks. Critical attacks should be attack_value * 2. It'll be a random number between 1 and 15 for normal classes, and 1 and 10 for the rogue.
# ... if random.int falls on that random number, it'll do a critical attack. 
# Create different paths, which leads to different rewards at the end of each battle.
# Create shop after every battle. Maybe every 2 battles and 1 before the final boss. 
# Import time for print statements, to make them quicker/faster
# Add dialogue for monsters
# Add \n (newlines) instead of empty print statements. Also add it to longer dialogues 
# Make the game open in a new window instead of staying on PyCharm. 
# Maybe use a while True: loop to give the player the option to quit the game?
