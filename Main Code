import random


# TO DO:
# Change dialogue to fit for each character Define different starting stats for each class (Attack, defense,
# block, evade, gold and dot(for the dragon))
# Create monsters and boss and their stats. Create combat! (Attack, defense, block, evade, health potion
# (only if player has one)) Attack values are between 2 numbers. A bit like rolling the dice.
# Defense is a percentage based reduction. 5 defense = 5% less damage taken Block is -50% any attacks. Sometimes,
# blocking can lead to a 100% damage reduction (critical block). I'll do this choosing a random number between 1 and 5,
# and ... if random.int falls on that number, it'll do a critical block
# Same thing for critical attacks. Critical attacks should be attack_value * 2.
# It'll be a random number between 1 and 15 for normal classes, and 1 and 10 for the rogue.
# if random.int falls on that random number, it'll do a critical attack.
# Create different paths, which leads to different rewards at the end of each battle. Create option to choose reward,
# or heal instead.
# Create shop after every battle. Maybe every 2 battles and 1 before the final boss.
# Import time for print statements, to make them quicker/faster
# Add dialogue for monsters Add \n (newlines) instead of empty print statements. Also add it to longer dialogues
# Make the game open in a new window instead of staying on PyCharm.
# Maybe use a while True: loop to give the player the option to quit the game?
